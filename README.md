HORUS X12S OpenTX v2.3.4 Telemetry Needs
. I'm a retired Commercial Pilot flying RC since 1966.  Now I fly Giant Scale Twins on a HORUS x12s, OpenTX v2.3.4, no flight controller, just a stabilizer for approaches in windy weather, and about 24 pieces of telemmetry that will keep me “In the Envelope”, should I loose a power plant. 

I was also a Database Engineer, using Visual C & Visual Basic GUI's for a couple of decades, 30 years ago, but don't have the time to re-educate myself in new Script syntax. I do need my telemetry on a Window's Tablet or Computer screen so my co-pilot can keep me on the numbers. (Because I still fly by the numbers!)  If you can help, please contact me!
